# heating-furnaces
A project focused on security aspects in web and IoT systems.

## Project structure
The project is divided into three main parts:
1. **Furnace Simulator** - a python script that simulates a furnace. It sends temperature data to the server and receive commands to manage the furnace.
2. **Backend** - a server that is responsible for communication with furnaces and frontend. It also stores data about furnaces and users.
3. **Frontend** - a flutter application that allows users to manage furnaces and view their data.

## Branches and merge requests
In project we use the following branches:
- `main` - the most stable version of the project
- `develop` - the main development branch

### Creating a new branch
When creating a new branch, the name should be in the following format:
`<username>/<branch_name>`

Eg. `Domciotomio/basic-frontend`

### Merge requests
For merging branches into `develop`, use merge requests. The merge request should be reviewed by at least one other person before merging.
