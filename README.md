# heating-furnaces
A project focused on security aspects in web and IoT systems.

## Project structure
The project is divided into three main parts:
1. **Furnace Simulator** - a python script that simulates a furnace. It sends temperature data to the server and receive commands to manage the furnace.
2. **Backend** - a server that is responsible for communication with furnaces and frontend. It also stores data about furnaces and users.
3. **Frontend** - a flutter application that allows users to manage furnaces and view their data.

## Start the project
*In the future* - the project will be dockerized and it will be possible to start it with one command.
